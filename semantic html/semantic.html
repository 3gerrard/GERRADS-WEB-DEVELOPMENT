            <ARTicle><P>We use Semantic HTML to select HTML
            elements based on their meaning rather than
            how they are displayed. Elements such as and
            are not semantic elements because they
            provide no context for what is contained within
            those tags.
            Example - Instead of using an element to hold
            our header information, we could use an
            element that serves as a heading section. We
            provide context for what information is inside
            the opening and closing tags by using a tag
            instead of a.</P></ARTicle>
