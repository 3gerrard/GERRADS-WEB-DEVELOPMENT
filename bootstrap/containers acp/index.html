        <h1>#2 CHARLIES ANGELS</h1>
        <P>Charlie's Angels is an American crime drama television series created by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts for ABC. It
        originally aired from September 22, 1976 to June 24, 1981, airing for five seasons consisting of 115 episodes. It was
        produced by Spelling-Goldberg Productions. The show follows the crime-fighting adventures of three women working at a
        private detective agency in Los Angeles, California, and originally starred Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett, and Jaclyn
        Smith in the leading roles and John Forsythe providing the voice of their boss, the unseen Charlie Townsend, who
        directed the crime-fighting operations of the "Angels" over a speakerphone.[1] There were a few casting changes: after
        the departure of Fawcett, Cheryl Ladd joined; after Jackson departed, Shelley Hack joined, and she was subsequently
        replaced by Tanya Roberts.[2]
        
        Despite mixed reviews from critics and a reputation for merely being "jiggle television" that emphasized the sex appeal
        of the female leads, Charlie's Angels was a top ten hit in the Nielsen ratings for its first two seasons. After the
        third season, however, the show had fallen from the top 10, and by the fifth season, from the Top 30.</P>
